#TGA Automation

Python program to process CSV data from a Thermogravimetric Analyzer (TGA), programmatically create spreadsheets, and generate visualizations of the results. Written with Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy

This program has a few related components. There is a "notification" program that will watch for when the TGA writes the CSV files to the given directory. Once the files are detected, a notification email will be sent.

The TGA_Automation app processes the CSVs, performs analytical computations, populates structured Excel sheets, and generates visualizations of the results.
